# Introduction

My name is **Dhyankumar Patel**, and I am a graduate student in **Computer Science at SUNY New Paltz**. I recently completed my undergraduate degree in **Information Technology** in India. In addition to my academic pursuits, I was actively involved in extracurricular activities during my undergraduate studies and served as a **treasurer for the college event committee**. As part of this role, I collaborated with my teammates to organize multiple events, including fundraisers, annual cultural nights, and open cricket tournaments. These experiences helped me develop strong **leadership, coordination, and organizational skills**.

## Academic Background

During my undergraduate program in Information Technology, I completed coursework in core computer science and engineering subjects, including:

- Data Structures  
- Software Engineering  
- Logic Design  
- Operating Systems  
- Internet of Things (IoT)  
- Machine Learning  
- Artificial Intelligence  

Exposure to these subjects played a significant role in inspiring me to pursue a **master’s degree in Computer Science**.

## Practical Experience

Alongside my academic coursework, I worked as a **web developer intern**, where I gained practical experience and learned key factors that contribute to the success of a project, including:

- Effective planning  
- Teamwork  
- Clear communication  

Additionally, during my undergraduate tenure, my team and I developed a project titled **“Osky Voice Assistant.”** This project focused on building a personalized assistant capable of performing basic functional tasks through user voice commands. It marked my **first hands-on undergraduate development experience** and strengthened my interest in applied software development.

## Goals

Through this course, I aim to strengthen my **foundational understanding of web development** and build upon it in a structured and practical manner. I believe the concepts learned in this course will help me design **well-organized, industry-relevant, and AI-integrated applications**, supporting both my academic growth and future professional endeavours.
